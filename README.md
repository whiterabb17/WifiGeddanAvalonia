# Requirements

- NpCap Driver on Windows (if not found/can be installed automatically)
- Currently GUI opens on all platforms, though actual airodump scans on run on *nix based systems
- Still in early stages of development.

# Currently implemented features:
-- Switching your adapter to interface mode
-- Performing AiroDump Scan and populating grids with results
